# The Ketchup Technique

> The planning methodology behind Ketchup

The Ketchup Technique is the methodology. The Quality Loop is the system. Ketchup is the tool.

- **The Ketchup Technique** gives fresh vocabulary for AI-assisted planning: Bottles, Bursts, dependencies, and the `ketchup-plan.md` format. It is the contract between your requirements and what the AI builds, a detailed, disciplined breakdown of work that keeps agents focused on rigorous software development.
- **The Quality Loop** is the four-component validation system that executes those plans: Auto-Planner, Validators, TCR Discipline, and Auto-Continue. It is the _what runs_.
- **Ketchup** is the open-source engine that implements both.

## The Trap

AI-assisted coding promised multiplication.

What it delivered was faster serial work with supervision requirements. You're still doing one thing at a time. You have help, but help that requires your constant attention.

The bottleneck moved from typing speed to cognitive load.

You're faster at producing, but you can't shift focus. You can't parallelize.

True multiplication requires trust. Trust that the system will execute correctly without you watching.

The Quality Loop earns that trust.

## The Quality Loop: Four Components

### 1. Auto-Planner

Feed your requirements. Get a complete plan.

```markdown
# ketchup-plan.md

## TODO

- [ ] Burst 1: createUser returns user object [depends: none]
- [ ] Burst 2: hashPassword uses bcrypt [depends: none]
- [ ] Burst 3: validatePassword checks hash [depends: 2]

## DONE

- [x] Burst 0: Project setup (abc123)
```

Oversight over every detail, ahead of time. The ketchup plan surfaces decisions before they're made, no opaque reasoning from agents.

### 2. Validators

An impartial AI validates every commit.

```
Claude attempts commit
        │
        ▼
┌───────────────────┐
│  Supervisor Hook  │
│  Checks:          │
│  - TDD compliance │
│  - 100% coverage  │
│  - Your ADRs      │
└────────┬──────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    ▼         ▼
  ACK       NACK
  Ships     Reverts
            & learns
```

Bad code is minimized because the adversarial AI follows rules you created. Validators are a highly customizable way to codify qualitative standards, like an intelligent lint enforcer.

### 3. TCR Discipline

Test && Commit || Revert. No middle ground.

```
Red → Green → TCR → Refactor → TCR → Done
```

- Tests pass → Commit automatically
- Tests fail → Revert completely
- Never patch failing code

Emergent design without bad foundations. When tests fail, revert and rethink, don't let the AI patch mistakes over and over.

### 4. Auto-Continue

Keeps going until the plan is done.

```
Burst completes
     │
     ▼
┌───────────────────┐
│  Stop Hook fires  │
│  Checks:          │
│  - ketchup-plan.md│
│  - Unchecked TODOs│
└────────┬──────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    ▼         ▼
  CONTINUE   STOP
  More work  Plan
  remains    complete
```

You check back on results, not babysit the process.

## The Core Loop

One test. One behavior. One commit.

Each **Burst** is atomic:

- Independent (can run in parallel if no dependencies)
- Valuable (delivers observable behavior)
- Small (easy to review, safe to revert)
- Testable (100% coverage by construction)

**Bottles** group related bursts by capability, not sequence number.

```markdown
### Bottle: Settings Merger

- [ ] Burst 26: mergeSettings loads settings.project.json
- [ ] Burst 27: mergeSettings loads settings.local.json
```

---

## Why It Works

### Emergent Design

Individual ants follow simple rules. Colonies exhibit complex behavior.

The Quality Loop works the same way:

- Each burst follows simple rules (red/green/TCR)
- Architecture emerges from passing tests
- No upfront design that AI will ignore anyway

### Context Preservation Across Reverts

When TCR reverts code, the learning stays:

- Claude remembers what failed
- It has a clean slate to try differently
- The context window contains the lesson

Reverts aren't punishment. They're information.

### 100% Coverage by Construction

If code exists, a test demanded it.

This isn't enforced through willpower. It's structural:

- Write test first (red)
- Write minimal code to pass (green)
- No code without a test

Uncovered code = code nobody asked for = deleted by next revert.

## Planning Rules

### Sub-Agent Rules

Sub-agents follow identical rules to the parent. When spawning a Task agent:

1. **Include Ketchup context** - Sub-agents receive the same reminders and rules automatically
2. **Include ketchup-plan.md** - Sub-agents work from the same plan
3. **No orphan work** - Sub-agent output must be committed by parent or sub-agent

### Parallelization

Maximize parallel execution. Launch multiple sub-agents when:

- Bursts have no dependencies on each other
- Exploration can be split by area
- Multiple files need similar changes

### Dependency Notation

Every burst ends with `[depends: ...]`:

```markdown
### Bottle: Authentication

- [ ] Burst 10: createUser returns user object [depends: none]
- [ ] Burst 11: hashPassword uses bcrypt [depends: none]
- [ ] Burst 12: validatePassword checks hash [depends: 11]
- [ ] Burst 13: generateToken creates JWT [depends: 10]
- [ ] Burst 14: login combines all [depends: 10, 12, 13]
```

**Rules:**

- `[depends: none]` - can start immediately, parallelizable
- `[depends: N]` - must wait for burst N to complete
- `[depends: N, M]` - must wait for bursts N and M to complete

---

## Git Worktrees: The Multiplier

The Quality Loop earns trust. Trust enables delegation. Delegation enables parallelization.

```bash
# Create worktrees for parallel features
git worktree add ../feature-auth feature/auth
git worktree add ../feature-payments feature/payments
git worktree add ../feature-dashboard feature/dashboard
```

Three isolated workspaces. Each running a Ketchup instance.

| Worktree            | Feature               | Status                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `feature-auth`      | Authentication system | Ketchup executing... |
| `feature-payments`  | Payment integration   | Ketchup executing... |
| `feature-dashboard` | Admin dashboard       | Ketchup executing... |

The bottleneck becomes defining requirements, not executing them.

---

## Workflow

1. Create `ketchup-plan.md` with TODO/DONE sections, commit before coding
2. Write ONE failing test
3. Write MINIMAL passing code
4. TCR (update plan in same commit)
5. Refactor if needed → TCR
6. Move burst to DONE → TCR
7. Next burst

### RETHINK After Revert

After a revert, do not immediately retry the same approach. Ask:

1. Was the burst too big? → Split it smaller
2. Was the design flawed? → Try a different approach
3. Was the test wrong? → Clarify the requirement first

Only then write the next failing test.

---

## Testing Rules

**Title = Spec:** Test body proves exactly what `it('should...')` claims. One assertion per behavior.

**Assertion Strength:** Never use weak assertions (`toBeDefined`, `toBeTruthy`, `not.toBeNull`). Assert the exact shape and value.

**Stubs over mocks:** Deterministic stubs preferred. Mock only at boundaries.

**Assert whole objects:** `expect(result).toEqual({...})` not cherry-picked properties.

**Squint test:** All tests must follow: SETUP → EXECUTE → VERIFY. No multiple execute/verify cycles.

**No state peeking:** Test observable behavior, not internal state.

| Forbidden (Implementation)                    | Allowed (Behavior)         |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `expect(tracker.getActiveCount()).toBe(0)`    | Test via callbacks/events  |
| `expect(manager.clientCount).toBe(3)`         | Test via return values     |
| `expect(service["internalMap"].size).toBe(2)` | Test via observable output |

---

## Coverage

100% enforced. No escape hatches.

Exclusions allowed ONLY for: barrel `index.ts` re-exports, `*.test.ts` files

| Do                              | Don't                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Let tests drive all code        | Write code without a failing test first  |
| Add branches only when tested   | Defensive `??`, `?:`, `if/else` untested |
| Test all error paths            | Leave error handling unverified          |
| Remove dead code after each run | Keep unused code "just in case"          |

---

## Design

Behavior first. Types/interfaces emerge from tests.

```ts
it("creates user with generated id", () => {
  const result = createUser({ name: "Alice" });
  expect(result).toEqual({ id: expect.any(String), name: "Alice" });
});
```

---

## Guardrails

- No comments, write self-expressing code
- JS files only in `dist/`
- When tests fail, assume you broke it

**Backwards compatibility:** Ask first. Default to clean breaks.

---

## Extreme Ownership

Every problem is your problem. No deflection.

See a problem → fix it or add a burst to fix it. No third option.

| Situation                | Wrong Response                         | Ownership Response            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Bug in existing code     | "The existing code has a bug where..." | Fix it or add burst to fix it |
| Test suite has gaps      | "Coverage was incomplete before..."    | Add the missing tests         |
| Confusing function names | "The naming is unclear..."             | Rename in refactor step       |

---

## Infrastructure Commits

Config files need no tests: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `.gitignore`, `ketchup-plan.md`

Format: `chore(scope): description`

---

## TCR Command

```bash
pnpm test --run && git add -A && git commit -m "<MSG>" || git checkout -- .
```
