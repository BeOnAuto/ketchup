# Getting Started

Install Claude Auto in 5 minutes.

**What you'll accomplish:**

- Install Claude Auto
- See the supervisor system in action
- Create your first skill (context injection)
- Set up file protection
- Understand how to parallelize with git worktrees

---

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed
- A project where you want to parallelize AI execution

---

## Step 1: Install Claude Auto

From within a Claude Code session:

```
/plugin marketplace add BeOnAuto/auto-plugins
/plugin install claude-auto
```

Or for local development:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/claude-auto
```

The plugin automatically:

- Creates reminders that inject your guidelines
- Sets up the supervisor that ACKs or NACKs changes
- Initializes hook state with sensible defaults

---

## Step 2: Verify Your Installation

```
/claude-auto:config show
```

Everything looks good? Claude Auto is active. The Quality Loop is running. You can now let it run and check back on outcomes.

---

## Step 3: Explore What Was Created

```bash
ls -la .claude/ .claude-auto/
```

See the [Architecture Guide](/architecture#directory-structure) for complete directory structure details.

---

## Step 4: Feed the System

Create your first reminder to inject YOUR rules into every session:

```bash
cat > .claude-auto/reminders/my-project.md << 'EOF'
---
when:
  hook: SessionStart
priority: 50
---

# My Project Guidelines

- TDD: Test first, code second
- One test, one behavior, one commit
- No comments in code
EOF
```

Now every Claude session starts with YOUR rules.

---

## Step 5: Protect Your Files

See the [Hooks Guide](/hooks-guide#protect-files-with-deny-list) for file protection setup.

---

## Step 6: Watch the System Work

Start a Claude Code session. The supervisor will:

1. **Inject** your guidelines at session start
2. **Validate** every commit against your rules
3. **ACK** clean commits, **NACK** rule violations
4. **Auto-continue** until the plan is complete

---

## Step 7: Multiply with Git Worktrees

Git worktrees let you have multiple working directories from the same repo:

```bash
# Create worktrees for parallel features
git worktree add ../feature-auth feature/auth
git worktree add ../feature-payments feature/payments
git worktree add ../feature-dashboard feature/dashboard
```

Run a Claude Auto instance in each worktree:

```bash
# Terminal 1 (feature-auth)
cd ../feature-auth
# Feed requirements, approve plan, start execution
# Claude Auto running...

# Terminal 2 (feature-payments)
cd ../feature-payments
# Feed requirements, approve plan, start execution
# Claude Auto running...

# Terminal 3 (feature-dashboard)
cd ../feature-dashboard
# Feed requirements, approve plan, start execution
# Claude Auto running...
```

Three features running simultaneously. All quality-validated.
