- 059a7b7: - Added test coverage for parsing Claude JSON output when cache token fields are missing
- 169ced8: This is a planning/infrastructure commit that added tasks to the ketchup plan but didn't make any user-facing changes. Since it's a `chore` commit that only modified the plan file, it doesn't represent actual feature delivery or bug fixes. This type of commit typically shouldn't appear in a user-facing changelog.

  However, if you need a changelog entry:

  - Added development plan for achieving 100% test coverage across the codebase

- e34de12: - Added test coverage for migrating from old `.ketchup` directory structure to new `.claude-auto` directory
- c04d3b8: Looking at the commit, this appears to be a test-only addition with no user-facing changes. For changelog purposes:

  - Added test coverage for maximum line enforcement during live log tailing

  However, if this is purely an internal test improvement with no user-facing behavioral changes, it might not warrant a changelog entry at all. Test-only commits typically don't appear in changelogs unless they're fixing a bug that was previously uncovered or documenting newly added behavior.

  Would you like me to:

  1. Omit this from the changelog (recommended for test-only commits)
  2. Keep the single bullet point above
  3. Review the actual code changes to see if there's a user-facing aspect I'm missing

- 1b484ae: - Added test coverage for handling missing input token counts during batch usage validation
- 11bc4d2: - Exported copyDir function from CLI package for external use
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for all three code branches in copyDir
- 1c98291: Looking at this commit, I can see it's a test-only change that adds coverage for a specific code path in the pre-tool-use hook. Since this is purely internal test coverage improvement with no user-facing changes, here's the changelog:

  - Improved test coverage for hook validation scenarios

- 7ba85aa: - Added test coverage for parsing batched output when receiving raw JSON arrays
- b3859e9: - Added runtime debug mode checking functionality with comprehensive test coverage
- 3296b16: These commits are all test coverage additions and minor refactors — no user-facing features, bug fixes, or behavioral changes. Here's the changelog:

  - Added comprehensive test coverage for CLI actions including install, TUI launch, and default help output
  - Added test coverage for core utilities including commit validation, output parsing, and process spawning
  - Added test coverage for hook behaviors including auto-continue and pre-tool-use validation
  - Removed dead code paths discovered during coverage improvements

- 19fc1b6: - Added test coverage for handling missing input token counts in Claude JSON output parsing
- 971a22e: Looking at this commit, it's a test-only change with no user-facing functionality. Since this adds test coverage but doesn't modify behavior or add features:

  - Improved test coverage for installation command default behavior

- 2d6c555: - Added batch count tracking to hook state for better execution monitoring
  - Updated build configuration to ignore local install scripts
- e480dfd: - Added test coverage for validator-loader to verify it correctly skips non-markdown files
